# AutoGroup Local Plugin

Automatically assigns enrolled users on a course into groups
dependant upon information within their user profile.  

This plugin will create, update, and delete groups automatically
to match the users on your course. All behaviour is event-driven
and so will occur within page loads.

The system can also monitor manual group setting changes and
moderate them to ensure that groups are kept neat and tidy.

## Install
